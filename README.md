Sentiment Analysis with Multinomial Naive Bayes
</b></h1>
This project aims to build a machine learning model for sentiment analysis using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. The model is trained on the IMDB movie review dataset, which consists of 40,000 movie reviews labeled as either positive or negative.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Dependencies</h2>

- NumPy 
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- bs4
<h2> Data Preprocessing </h2>
Before training the model, the movie review data needs to be preprocessed. This includes splitting the data into training and test sets, and vectorizing the text data using CountVectorizer.
<br>
<br>
<h2> Training the Model </h2>
The Multinomial Naive Bayes model is trained using the training data. The model is then evaluated on the test set using accuracy as the evaluation metric.
<br>
<br>
<h2> Using the Model </h2>
Once the model is trained, it can be used to classify new movie reviews as either positive or negative.
<br>
<br>
<h2> Conclusion </h2>
The Multinomial Naive Bayes model trained on the IMDB movie review dataset is able to classify movie reviews as positive or negative with high accuracy. This model can be useful for applications such as analyzing customer reviews or social media posts.
